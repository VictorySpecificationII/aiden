Calling Aiden's name is the gateway to communication - just like a real human.
There should be an algorithm that decides the response Aiden will give when called, based on time of day, etc.
There should be 2 types of input;

i)   Commmands
ii)  Questions

Depending on the command, additional communication (usually in the form of questions by Aiden, or sometimes commands that run on user space - NEVER root) may occur to set ECU/GCU parameters.

Output is dependent on command/question, too many to list here.

While Aiden is processing speech, the voice recognition software loop should be halted to avoid unexpected behaviour. Only once he answers back is the loop allowed to continue.
